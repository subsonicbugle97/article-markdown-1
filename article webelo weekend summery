Scouting 101 used to be named webelos weekend but was changed in 2024. Although this change baffled many people, the reason why it exists does not. There are many purposes of it including explaining skills, demonstrating these skills, guiding them to a better path, and enabling cub scouts to succeed. 

  The purpose of scouting 101 is to show webelos and arrow of lights what being in a scouts BSA troop is like. It also teaches them how to be a better cub scout and person. It also shows them how to retire the flag of the United States with honor.

  In scouting 101 the arrow of lights are put into patrols. The way of teaching these patrols  is through rotations. For example while one patrol is in a class about orienteering while another patrol is learning about weather apps. This also fits extremely well with meals and ceremonies. 
 
   There are many different activities in Scouting 101. There are classes, ceremonies, and meals. This means that your scout will have a packed day. This does not mean that they have no free time.
